# Rename-Files-and-Folders-in-Directory
Renames the files in a specific folder. It also renames folder if present within a folder. Just renames the file without changing the extension



### Working

Just run the code file by providing a folder / directoy.

This code not only just renames the files in the folder / directory, if there are folders present in the selected directory then it renames the folder first and then 
renames the files in the directory.

This does not change the extension of the files, whatever the files are they are just renamed and no change is done to the extension.

### User Input
You can select what `name` to give the files and from where to start the `numbering`, both of these parameters are user defined.
