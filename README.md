# Rename-Files-Folders-in-Directory
Renames the files in a specific folder. It also renames folder if present within a folder. Just renames the file without changing the extension



### Working

This code not only just renames the files in the folder / directory, if there are folders present in the selected directory then it renames the folder first and then 
renames the files in the directory.


### User Input
You can select what `name` to give the files and from where to start the `numbering`, both of these parameters are user defined.
